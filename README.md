PREPARATION
========
To install doorGets, you need a remote web server or on your computer (MAMP), with access to a database like MySQL. You'll need access to phpMyAdmin to create a database and to indicate the information in the database in the installer.

If you do not host and unable to create your store, we offer a turnkey store, which lets you create your online store in less than 10 minutes without any technical knowledge.
